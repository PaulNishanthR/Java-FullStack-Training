In the morning session I have learned the JavaScript properties that I wil be used in the future most.
After that I've done the below programs using JavaScript:
    1. Adding three numbers
    2. CM to M convertor
    3. EMI calculator
    4. Amount spreading
    5. Changing the button color
In the evening session the trainer shows the complete UI design of a random E-commerce application.
